# BLUETOOTH_REMOTE_CONTROLLED_CAR
In this project, we make a multi-functional robot using the Arduino platform. That is, this includes obstacle avoidance, Bluetooth control, and voice control functions. Also, It mainly uses an Ultrasonic sensor and a Bluetooth module. The L293D motor drive shield is used to drive the motors.

We can control this robot car using three methods. That is,
1.Obstacle avoidance:-
In this case, the robot car moves along using the obstacle avoiding. The ultrasonic sensor is mainly used for this purpose.

2.Bluetooth control:-
In this case, we can control the robot through an app on the smartphone. The Bluetooth module is used for this.

3.Voice control:-
In this case, we can control this robot using several voice commands. This also requires a Bluetooth module and mobile app.
